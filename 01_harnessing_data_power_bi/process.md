# Data Analyss Process

1. Define analysis purpose
2. Data collection
3. Data processing
4. Data exploration and analysis
5. Data reporting

### Define purpose
1.Analysis purpose -> 2.Relevant types of data -> 3.Data scope
Requirements: (Questions to stakeholders + Insights from patterns, trends, relationships from analyses)
Type of data and scope of data understanding

By doing this we can now collect: relevant data -> relevant insights.

### Data collection
It could be from:
Sales, Customer, Manufacturing, Purchasing, Inventory, Marketing, R+D. (NORMALLY IN RAW FORMAT)
RAW DATA: different formats, missing values, duplicate entries, different sources.

### Data processing and data analysis
Data processing: transform raw data, it involves data integration (CONSOLIDATE data from different sources).

RAW DATA: multiple souces, different formats, missing values, duplicate entries.

ETL Process = Data processing.

### Data analysis
Calculations, Vizualizations

Calculations:
- Total revenue
- Profit margin
- average order value

Vizualizations:
- represent data
- communicate information
- aid understanding
- uncover insights

### sharing insights (data reporting)
- access and seccurity.
- accesibility, color schemes, font sizes.
-storage, backup, refresh schedules.
