# Accesibility in Power BI
Accesible reports involves various considerations:
1. Choose easily interpretable vizualizations. Avoid complex designs
    - Use clear and concise titles and labels, provide alt text for images
2. Use color contrast for: text and background
3. Use proper headers and scope in tabular data. Avoid using merged cells
4. Use plain language and clear, concise sentences. Avoid using tech jargon without explanation
