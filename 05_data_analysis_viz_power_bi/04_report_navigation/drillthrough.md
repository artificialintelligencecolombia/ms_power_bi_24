# Drillthrough
Drillthrough in Power BI allows users to navigate from a summary report to a detailed report by right-clicking a data point and passing contextual filters to another page.

### Steps to Create Drillthrough
A. Create a Drillthrough Page
1️⃣ Create a new report page in Power BI.
2️⃣ Add necessary visuals and KPIs for detailed analysis.
3️⃣ Drag a field (e.g., Customer, Product) into the Drillthrough Filters pane.
4️⃣ (Optional) Enable "Keep all filters" to retain report context.
5️⃣ Power BI automatically adds a Back button (you can customize it).

B. Use Drillthrough in Reports
1️⃣ Go to the main report page (summary page).
2️⃣ Right-click on a data point in a visual (e.g., sales bar chart).
3️⃣ Select Drillthrough → [Target Report Page].
4️⃣ The detailed report opens with filters applied.
5️⃣ Click the Back button to return to the main report.

### Tips & Tricks
✅ Use "Keep all filters" to maintain additional report context.
✅ Customize the Back button by replacing it with an image or icon.
✅ Add multiple drillthrough fields for flexible navigation.
