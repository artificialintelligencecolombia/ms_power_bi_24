### Key Components for Performance Tuning
- Data Queries (sources of data)
- Data Model (relationships, data types, etc.)
- DAX Queries (calculated columns, measures, etc.)
- Visuals (charts, tables, etc.)
- Report (pages, layout, etc.)
- Filters (slicers, page filters, etc.)

### Performance Tuning
1. **Identify the problem areas:** The first step is to figure out what's causing the lag. Use the Power BI PerformanceAnalyzer to identify which queries, visualizations, or data models are slow. Pinpoint problem areas so you know exactly where to direct your optimization efforts.

2. **Optimize data queries:** The next step focuses on slimming down your data queries. Trim down your data queries to fetch only the required fields. Remove any unnecessary calculations or transformations that are being performed during data import.

3. **Streamline the data model:** Once your queries are leaner, ensure that your data model is designed efficiently. Use appropriate indexing, relationships, and data types to optimize performance. Star schema designs and flattening tables where possible is a good practice to follow.

4. **Improve visualizations:** While a scatter plot or a 3D map might look impressive, they can be resource-intensive. Whenever possible, opt for simpler effective visuals that are less demanding on system resources. The goal is to convey information in the quickest and most effective way.

5. **Use aggregations and summarization:** Your report users may not need to see every single data point in detail. Instead of displaying all data, consider using summarized data and allow drill-downs to details. This reduces the initial data load, making your reports quicker to interact with.

6. **Caching and pre-loading data:** Power BI has excellent caching capabilities. You can leverage these to store queries that are often run, thus reducing the time it takes to fetch this data.

7. **Monitoring and iterating:** Finally, remember that performance tuning is an ongoing process. The data landscape and user requirements are always evolving, and your Power BI reports need to keep up. Regularly monitor your reportâ€™s performance metrics and adapt as needed.
