# BI Terms

### 1. Profit margin
- Finantial metric
- Profitability indicator
- (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue
- Profit margin by date, Profitability by products

### 2. Gross Profit
gross profit = revenue - (raw materials + labor + factory overhead)
Factory Overhead = Indirect costs related to production (e.g., utilities, depreciation, maintenance)

### 3. Operating expenses
rent for the office spaces, salaries of non-production employees, insurance, utility costs, and equipment upkeep. Keeping track of operating expenses is critical for company to identify areas to improve cost efficiency, thus boosting net income.

### 4. Net Income
Revenue - ( cost of goods sold, expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest, and taxes, and other expenses for an accounting period)

#### Breakdown of Components:
Revenue (Sales): Total income from selling goods or services.
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Direct costs of production (raw materials, labor, manufacturing overhead).
Operating Expenses (OPEX): Indirect costs (marketing, admin, rent, utilities, salaries, etc.).
Depreciation & Amortization: Non-cash expenses reducing asset value over time.
Interest Expenses: Costs of debt financing (loans, bonds, etc.).
Taxes: Corporate income taxes.
Other Expenses: Any additional costs (legal fees, write-offs, etc.).

### 5. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): 
COGS refers to the direct costs of producing the goods a company sells. In the case of Adventure Works, this would include the cost of raw materials such as metal and composite materials used in the manufacturing of their bicycles, as well as direct labor costs involved in the production process. It would not include indirect expenses such as distribution and sales force costs. COGS is an important figure as it is subtracted from a company's revenue to determine its gross profit.

1. Manufacturing Companies

✅ Direct Labor – Wages of workers directly involved in production
✅ Factory Overhead – Costs directly tied to manufacturing, including:
    Utilities (electricity, water, gas for production)
    Equipment maintenance and repairs
    Depreciation of manufacturing equipment
    Factory rent or mortgage
    Quality control costs
✅ Packaging Costs – Materials used for final product packaging
✅ Freight & Shipping (Inbound) – Transportation of raw materials to the factory

2. Retail & Wholesale Businesses
✅ Purchase Cost of Goods – Cost of acquiring inventory for resale
✅ Freight & Shipping (Inbound) – Cost of transporting inventory to storage

3. Software Development & Digital Products (if applicable to SaaS or cloud services)
✅ Direct Software Development Costs – Salaries of engineers specifically developing a product
✅ Cloud Infrastructure Costs – Server and hosting fees directly tied to service delivery
✅ Third-Party Software & API Costs – Essential software licenses needed for product functionality

#### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in the Real Estate Industry

2. Rental Property Businesses (When Selling a Property)
For landlords or real estate investors, COGS applies only when selling a property, not for ongoing rental income.
✅ Original Purchase Price of Property
✅ Capital Improvements – Major upgrades (roof replacement, new HVAC, structural changes)
✅ Depreciation (If Applicable on Sold Property) – Recovery of asset value over time

Key Considerations in Real Estate COGS
