- EDA: dig deeper to find patterns
- Inferential: uses available data to make predictions about bigger population of the data.

Visualizations:
map, line chart, pie chart, etc.

### 5. Data Management
Ensures  consistency, integrity and security of data. It helps stakeholders trust in the data and its analysis.
