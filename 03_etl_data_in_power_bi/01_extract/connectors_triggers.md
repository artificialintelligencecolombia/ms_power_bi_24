# Connectors and triggers
### Connectors
- Its purpose is to combine data from different sources. 
- (Data integration)
- Connectors are links that transport data between the data source and the application.
- Bridges that connect power bi to the different data sources

Note: All connectors are listed in the 'Get data from other sources' section. Those are the famous connectors.

Note: remember, when I connect from powerbi to a data source, the connection is happening from the machine. This is important for network implications and authentication.

Data Source == Connector

### Considerations
- Data source: local (on premises) or external
- Who will use the data
- How the data will be used
- The business requeriments

Note: All power bi connectors are free to use.

### Triggers
Triggers are an essential functionality in Power BI that allow you to automate tasks based on specific conditions. By configuring a trigger, you can schedule an action to execute at a particular time or when a particular event occurs.
