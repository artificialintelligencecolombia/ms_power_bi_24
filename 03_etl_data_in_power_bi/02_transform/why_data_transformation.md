# Why data needs to be transformed
- Repairing poorly structured for analysis (errors, inconsistencies, inaccuracies, etc)

- Inconsistencies: can come from any type of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)

- Merging data is a type of transformation.

- data filtering == data cleaning

- Power query can handles larga datasets efficiently
- Power query editor -> Get data -> Transform.
- Power query reusability -> Applied steps

### Data types
- numbers. decimal number (15 decimals), fixed decimal (4 decimal), integer.
- dates or times. date/time, date, time, date/time/timezone, duration
- text, bool, binary

### Common errors
There are three main types of errors that youâ€™ll encounter as a data analyst. These are:

1. Missing or null values: replace (columns)
2. Duplicate rows: delete duplicates(rows)
3. Inconsistent data types: Transform data type.

- If the errors are not identified, then their inclusion will lead to inaccurate, skewed, and inflated results. 
- They can also give rise to extra, unnecessary storage and processing requirements.
