# Best Practices

### Enhance power query workflows
1. Plan and document
Stablish the desired output -> Identify data sources -> the transformations required -> Documents and data source credentials

###  Selection of proper connectors to connect to data sources
To keep a secured and well organized connection to data source, consider:
- Type and location of data sources
- Volume of data 
- Connectivity options

Note: Considering the performance and optimization of the data transformation process, it is recommended to follow the principle of "do expensive operations last"

### Resource intensive operations
- Complex calculations
- Merge large datasets
- Multiple transformations

### Error handling
- Error handling  techniques
- Conditional logic
- Error messages
- Data validation checks

### Merge strategy
- Most effective merging strategy
- Select inner joins when applicable
- Remove unnecessary columns/rows

### Create groups
???

### Remove unnecessary steps
- Unnecessary transformations

### Monitoring performance
- Refresh speed
- Resources consumption
- Overall efficiency
