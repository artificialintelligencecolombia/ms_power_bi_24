# Generative AI

### Features

Generative AI is a field within artificial intelligence. It focuses on developing algorithms that can generate novel content, such as text, images, audio, or video, from existing data. 

Genare content across:
- Text
- Images/Audio
- Code

### Types of GenAI
- GANs: involves 2 neural networks: generator (chef), discriminator (food critic). They work in tandem.
- Transformer-based models: use attention mechanisms to create text relevant to the context. Components: selective focus, highlight information, coherent, contextually appropriate. This model needs to be trained.

### GenAI in Businesses
(Example, chef)

Chef -> Kitchen staff
Company -> AI assistants -> insights, ideas, efficiencies.
Creativity, Strategy -> Repetitive tasks

1. Marketing and customer engagement: 
email marketing campaign
dynamic web content

2. Operation and logistics:
forecast demand trends
simulate supply chain scenarios
recommend adjustments

3. Human resources:
simulate training scenarios
provide personalized training experiences

4. Management & Legal:
Draft contracts
Ensumer compliance

### GenAI for Writing
We can configure the tone, stryle, and target audience and adapt to different 
- Product descriptions
- Marketing copy
- News articles
- Handle inquiries (crm)
- Provide responses (crm)

### Limitations and ethical concerns
Quality of output can vary depending on the model training
Inaccuracies can emerge
Potential to amplify biases

1. Data privacy
2. Intellectual property
3. Potential for misuse

Its needed to stablish ethical guidelines and best practices to mitigate these risks.
