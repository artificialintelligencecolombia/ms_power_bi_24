# SORT & FILTER
They're excel commands that reposition data in excel.
They don´t change the data, they change how the data is displayed.

### Sorting
Reorders the worksheet. 

#### NOTE:
- Once we save the changes after sorting, undoing the sorting is not possible.
- Sorting: When you sort, Excel looks at the entire table or range, not just the column. It organizes rows based on the selected column but keeps all rows together.


### Filtering
Refines data displayed based on the desired criteria. This function hides the undesirable data.

#### NOTE: 
- Sort and filter works column based, therefore if we click over any row and apply the functions, then the whole column will be affected.
- Filtering: When you filter, Excel hides rows that don’t match your filter in the selected column, but the rest of the data stays linked.
