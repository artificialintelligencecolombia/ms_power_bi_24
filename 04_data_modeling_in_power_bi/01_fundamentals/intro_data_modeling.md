# Data Modeling
Consists in the creation of visual representations of the data in power bi. This allow us to:
- Identify the relationships between different data tables
- We can generate new insights from it to improve business performance

1. Schemas (Flat, Star, Snowflake). Relationships: one to one, one to many, many to many
2. DAX
3. Optimization performance in a Power BI model
### Data Modeling in Power Bi
Power Bi allows us to:
- Create new data models (schemas and relationships)
- Analyze existing data models (DAX)
- Optimize data models

### What is data modeling?
- Creation of a structured representation of data. It also outlines the rules that influence the interaction between those data sources (tables)
- Data  modeling can define the relationships between tables and asign the data types
- We can also create calculated columns and measures
- We can update the already existing model as the business requirements change

### Data model process
1. Connect to data sources (Power Query Editor)
2. ETL (data cleaning, Power Query Editor)
3. Configure the data (column and table properties)
4. Create relationships between tables (Powe BI model view)
5. Create calculated columns and measures (DAX to create aggregations and custom calculations)
6. Optimize the model 

#### Outcome:
- Enhanced performance
- Simplified calculations
- Improved analysis and insights
- Accurate reports
