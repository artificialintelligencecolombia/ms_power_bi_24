# Data view
Data View in Power BI is the intersection where data meets analysis. It's a rich environment where data analysts can observe, explore, interact with, and transform raw data into meaningful insights.

We have:
- Report view: where visualizations are created and arranged.
- Data view: where data is imported, transformed, and modeled.
- Model view: where data is modeled and relationships.

#### Data view options
Data view is where data is transformed from raw to actionable insights. It provides a range of options to manipulate data, including:
- Sorting
- Filtering
- Adding calculated columns
- Formatting columns

As result, in the data view, data analysts can:
- Spot anomalies
- Identify trends
- Form hypotheses

Data analysts have the capabilities to inspect data, so he/she can verify:
1. Data accuracy
2. Data completeness
3. Data consistency
4. Error free information

### Data View UI elements
1. Data(right sidebar): list all tables and fields in the data model
2. Data grid: displays data in a tabular format
3. Column tools: offer functionalities to manage and manipulate individual columns in your table. With these tools, you can sort columns, manage relationships, and format data (like changing number formats or setting date formats).
4. Table tools: operations on your entire table. This includes managing table properties, creating new columns (such as calculated columns), and categorizing data. 
5. Column headers: display the name of the column and the data type. You can also sort columns by clicking on the column header.
