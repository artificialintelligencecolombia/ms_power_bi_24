# DAX Functions
A function is a named formula within an expression. Most functions have required and optional arguments, also called parameters, as input. When the function is executed, a value is returned. 

DAX includes functions to perform calculations using dates and times, create conditional values, work with strings, perform lookups based on relationships, and iterate over a table to perform recursive calculations. Some of the most used classes of DAX functions are given below.

### Text Functions
You can use these functions to return part of a string, search for text within a string or concatenate string values to create a new column.

#### CONCATENATE function
you can join two text strings into one text string. For example, you can combine an employeeâ€™s first name and last name into a new column by defining a DAX formula as follows:

```
Full Name = CONCATENATE (Employees[FirstName], CONCATENATE ( " ", Employees[LastName] ) )
```

#### LEFT function 
returns the leftmost characters from a text value. For example, you could create a column that shortens the names of the months for better visualization purposes. The LEFT function allows you to create a column with only the first three letters of each month as follows:

```
Short Name = LEFT (Date[Month], 3)
```

### Date/Time Functions
These functions in DAX are like date and time functions in Microsoft Excel. However, DAX functions are based on the datetime data types used by Microsoft SQL Server.

- NOW(): The NOW function displays the current date and time on a worksheet or calculates a value based on the current date and time. It updates the value each time you open the worksheet.

- YEAR(<date>): Returns the year of a date as a four-digit integer from the date column. You can add a column for a year from your date table.

- MONTH(<date>): Returns the month of a date as a number (1 - 12).

### Logical Functions
These functions evaluate logical conditions and return true or false values.

- IF(<logical_test>, <value_if_true>, <value_if_false>): Returns one value if a condition is true and another value if it is false.

- AND(<logical1>, <logical2>): Returns TRUE if all its arguments are TRUE; returns FALSE if one or more argument is FALSE.

- OR(<logical1>, <logical2>): Returns TRUE if any argument is TRUE; returns FALSE if all arguments are FALSE.

- NOT(<logical>): Reverses the logic of its argument.

### Aggregation Functions
These functions perform aggregations. Commonly these functions create sums and averages and find minimum and maximum values. You can also filter a column in DAX based on related tables, before creating aggregations. Common aggregation functions are:

- COUNT(<column>): Returns the count, or total, of all rows in a column.

- SUM(<column>): Returns the sum of all values in a column.

- AVERAGE(<column>): Returns the average of all values in a column.

- MIN(<column>): Returns the smallest value in a column.

- MAX(<column>): Returns the largest value in a column.

### Time Intelligence Functions
These functions create calculations using built-in knowledge of calendars and dates. You can build meaningful comparisons across comparable periods for sales, inventory, and so on using time and date ranges combined with aggregations or calculations.

- SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(<dates>): Returns a parallel period calculated against the dates provided.

- DATESYTD(<dates>): Returns dates from the beginning of the year until the last date in the dates column provided.

- DATESMTD(<dates>): Returns dates from the beginning of the month until the last date in the provided dates column.

- DATESQTD(<dates>): Returns dates from the beginning of the quarter until the last date in the provided dates column.

- EDATE(<start_date>, <months>): Returns the date that is a specified number of months before or after the start date.

### Statistical Functions
These functions calculate values related to statistical distributions and probability, such as standard deviation and number of permutations. Common statistical functions are:

- STDEV.P(<ColumnName>): Returns the standard deviation of the entire population.

- MEDIAN(<column>): Returns the median of numbers in a column.

- RANKX(<table>, <expression>[, <value>[, <order>[, <ties>]]]): Returns the ranking of a number in a list of numbers for each row in the table argument.

### Relational Functions
These functions are for managing and utilizing relationships between tables. For example, you can specify a particular relationship to be used in a calculation.

- RELATED(<column>): Returns a related value from another table.

- RELATEDTABLE: Evaluates a table expression in a context modified by the given filters.

### Information Functions
These functions look at a table or column provided as an argument to another function and determine if the value matches the expected type.

- ISBLANK(<expression>): Checks if a value is blank and returns TRUE or FALSE.

- CONTAINS(<table>, <column>, <value>): Checks if the values in a column already exist in another column and returns a value of TRUE or FALSE.

### Points to remember:
- DAX is not case-sensitive but distinguishes between blanks and zeros.
- Use comments to explain your code. You can use // for a single-line comment and /* ... */ for a multi-line comment.
- Remember, many DAX functions require an existing relationship between tables, so ensure your data model is set up correctly.
- Study row and filter context, as they are fundamental to understanding and using DAX effectively.
